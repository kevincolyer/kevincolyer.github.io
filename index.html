   <h1 class="bg-warning">Kevin's Pioneer Portfolio - Barne Barton Youth Cells</h1>
<p>During those first years in Plymouth, we learned much about the city and the people and found ourselves increasingly drawn in prayer to the western side of the city, close to the dockyard and naval base. For decades (centuries even) the most deprived and needy part of this historic city. The churches there were fewer and less resources though with amazing mission going on in so many places.</p>

<p>I had a chance encounter with a lady called Pat, who was a member of a lay order of St Francis of Assisi. Unknown to me she was dying of cancer. She was dedicated to an area of the city called Barne Barton, a housing development of 5,000-6,000 people on an isolated hill bordered by the river Tamar and the dockyard. Pat had been doing pastoral visiting on the estate, which had a long history of deprivation, having been a naval housing area and then the dumping ground for all the problem families from other troubled estates of Plymouth. There were only two ways by foot or car in and out of the estate. It was so isolated and the culture so different from the rest of the local St Budeaux area that it that was without any realistic church.</p>

<p>We decided that this was where God was calling YWAM and that he particularly wanted us to plant a church for the people of the Barne Barton. We rented some houses and moved the Operation Year teams there for three years.</p>

<p>One remarkably 18 year old trainee, Lisa, was crucial to what happened. When being pelted with stones by some rough lads on the estate she got even more determined to reach them with the Gospel. What emerged over the next years was a youthwork with a cell church for the young people that met in different flats on the estate. Hundreds of young people were contacted and a few dozen came to the cells.</p> 

<p>It was tough work. The team explored creative ways of worshipping (we had no musicians and the kids were not into singing much.) I recall one prayer time with a candle in the centre and 5 teenage lads sitting around in their motorcycle helmets, visors down!</p>

<p>On reflection we really needed more resources to help the team engage with the area. We also needed confidence that we were really right in planting a church. There were few people cheering YWAM on to do the planting in the local area. The nearest other YWAM centre was 3 to 4 hours away and although we had some excellent and regular visitors, there was little in the way of support and coaching to complete the plant. The young people grew in discipleship but not really in leadership enough to keep the cells alive without outside support.</p>

<p>After a number of years the project was transitioned into a local church but was not able to continue. There were masses of fruit from the project and many young people deeply touched. There are ongoing discussions for some form of church to be there and increasing desire from adult residents to make it happen. Lisa still lives on the estate.</p>
